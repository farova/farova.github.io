Currently in 1B Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. 

Electronics and computers have always fascinated me as I was growing up. I have always wanted to learn more about how it all works. The more I ever learned about it, the more I wanted to know more. There is just so much to learn, and hopefully my university experience will deepen my understanding and desire for more knowledge. 

* Some hobbies of mine include:
* hardware design and creation
* web design
* oil painting: abstract and landscape
* programming
* reading science fiction novels (mostly fantasy)
* gaming: FPSs and RPGs
* karate: 1st Kyu Brown Belt (2006-present)","google":""}
