{"name":"Michaela Farova","tagline":"","body":"My name is Michaela Farova and I am currently studying computer engineering at University of Waterloo. Technology has always amazed me and thus I was drawn to studying it further. I enjoy coding and designing in my spare time as well as other hobbies such as painting, rock climbing, reading and gaming.\r\n\r\nI have started a personal website in Feb 2005 and still manage it to show off my art and code.
