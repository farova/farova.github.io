		<h3 id="About">&gt;&gt; About Me</h3>
		My name is Michaela Farova.
		<br/>
		Currently in 1B Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.
		<br/><br/>
		Electronics and computers have always fascinated me as I was growing up. I have always wanted to learn more about how it all works. The more I ever learned about it, the more I wanted to know more. There is just so much to learn, and hopefully my university experience will deepen my understanding and desire for more knowledge.
		<br/><br/>
		Some hobbies of mine include:
		<ul>
			<li>hardware design and creation</li>
			<li>web design</li>
			<li>oil painting: abstract and landscape</li>
			<li>programming</li> 
			<li>reading science fiction novels (mostly fantasy)</li>
			<li>gaming: FPSs and RPGs</li>
			<li>karate: Black Belt (1st Dan) (2006-present)</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Programming Languages</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>C#</li>
			<li>Java</li>
			<li>Visual Basic</li>
			I have learned C# as a part of my 1A term during university. It was the language all first year students were required to learn. I was taught Java and Visual Basic during high school courses, grades 12 and 11 respectively.
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Databases</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>MySQL</li>
			<li>SQLite</li>
			I taught myself to use MySQL when I began building websites a few years back. I also taught myself SQLite when I began coding apps for Android and Playbook.
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Web Development</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>PHP</li>
			<li>HTML</li>
			<li>CSS</li>
			<li>Twig</li>
			<li>YAML</li>
			All web-based languages were self-taught. I started this when I first began building my personal website in 2005. Ever since then I have expanded my skills and understanding on web development and design to create efficiently coded and well designed websites.
		</ul>
		
		<h4>App Development</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Android</li>
			<li>Playbook</li>
			I began developing apps for Android and the Playbook in 2012 during my 1A coop term using Java and XML. This was all self-taught and I, along with a partner, have created a very popular app that is used by thousands of people. (See the Projects section for more information)
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Software</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Git</li>
			<li>Eclipse</li>
			<li>Photoshop</li>
			<li>AutoCAD</li>
			<li>SolidEdge</li>
			<li>Microsoft Office</li>
			<li>Blender</li>
			Almost all of the software listed were self-taught. I have spent countless hours working with the above software and have used them to put together many projects over the past couple of years.
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Other</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Writing Documentation and Technical Reports</li>
			I have written many technical reports for school (both high school and university) and a 40 page documentation during a coop term.
		</ul>

		<h4>League of Legends Companion App, <em>March 2012</em> - <a href="https://github.com/farova/LeagueOfLegendsCompanionApp">Github Link</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LoLCompanionApp&hl=en">Android Market</a>, <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/87604/?lang=en">Playbook App World</a></h4>
		
		This app was developed with a partner and was created to provide users with information about a large online video game (League of Legends). It was programmed in Java and XML which allowed it to be compatible for both Playbook and Android devices. Within the app, we have a SQLite database that holds all of the data. Github was used extensively during the development of the project, and the code may be viewed on my Github page.
		
		
		<h4>Personal Website, <em>February 2005 - present</em> - <a href="http://inlimite.com">Website Link</a></h4>
		
		I have created my website back in 2005. I began with no knowledge at all about any sort of web design or coding, and have learned it all independently during my free time. Since 2005, I have learned many techniques on how to design and code a website that is efficient and maintainable. The languages I have taught myself over the years include: PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL. A MySQL database was also implemented in my website to store data. Most recently, I have developed a custom MVC structured framework that will greatly improve the efficiency and reusability of code.  
		

		<h4>Firefighter Robot,<em> High School Computer Engineering Class, February – June 2011</em></h4>
		
		During my grade 12 Computer Engineering class, me and a partner have designed and manufactured a firefighting robot. We began with only a schematic of the circuits we were to use given to us by the teacher. From there we designed the circuit boards, manufactured them using a multi-step process, drilled the holes and soldered the various components onto them. Once our boards were completed, we began programming the code that was to process the various sensor inputs and creating a searching pattern to take the robot around the maze. The process of creating and testing the robots was a very long one, and we have very tight deadlines to meet during the term. In the end, we created a fully functional, autonomous robot that is able to navigate a maze to find fire and put it out.

		
		
		<h3 id="WorkExperience">&gt;&gt; Work Experience</h3>

		<h4>Technical Support Technician, <em>DC Library, University of Waterloo,
		Jan-Apr 2012</em></h4>
		
		<ul>
		 <li>Developed code bundles for Symfony, a MVC structured PHP framework</li>
		 <li>Used version control software (Git) during bundle development</li>
		 <li>Trained staff in the usage of the Symfony framework</li>
		 <li>Documented the creation process and instructions on working with various components in a 40 page documentation</li>
		 <li>Provided technical support for university students and staff</li>
		</ul>
		During my 1A coop work term I had two major responsibilities. The first and foremost was to provide technical support to any students and staff. This could be something simple like connection to the internet to more complex problems like when a student's laptop was rejecting certain certificates. The second responsibility I had during my work term was to work with a new framework called Symfony. It was my job to learn everything there is to know about it, teach it to staff members and then document everything to provide a reference document that the staff can use once I finished my work term.
