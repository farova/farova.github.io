                    My name is Michaela Farova.
                    <br/>
                    Currently in 2B Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo, Canada.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Electronics and computers have always fascinated me and I have always tried to learn as much as I could. Learning about programming and computers in general started out as a hobby, and as it turned out it eventually became my primary focus. Thus I decided to turn it into a career path since I already knew that this was something that will always fascinate and challenge me. Technology is the future and I'm excited to see what happens.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Some hobbies of mine include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>web design and development (Check out my <a href="http://inlimite.com">site</a>!)</li>
                        <li>programming</li> 
                        <li>oil painting: abstract and landscape</li>
                        <li>reading science fiction novels (mostly fantasy)</li>
                        <li>gaming: FPSs and RPGs</li>
                        <li>rock climbing</li>
                        <li>karate: Black Belt (1st Dan)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Software Development Co-op, <em>Tangam Gaming, Waterloo,
                            Sep-Dec 2012</em></h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed various new features for an analysis software used by casinos worldwide</li>
                        <li>Optimized and coded back-end functionalities of the product using the Asp.NET framework</li>
                        <li>Designed the front-end portion of the product using HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery.</li>
                        <li>Worked with Microsoft based technologies including Microsoft SQL Server and Visual Studio </li>
                        <li>Used SVN version control software during development</li>
                    </ul>
                    My 1B workterm was spent working for Tangam, there I worked on a product that analyzes a casino's data and summarizes and predicts trends in order to optimize revenue. The software was based on the Asp.NET framework and thus I got a lot of exposure to Microsoft products such as Visual studio and the Microsoft SQL Server. Most of my work was based around developing new features for the product, these projects ranged from small additions to an existing page or large changes such as a new login system. I have also developed multiple administrative features that helped our team determine the status of a casino. All of my features have been included in the release versions of the product and are being used in casinos worldwide.

                    <h4>Technical Support Technician, <em>DC Library, University of Waterloo,
                            Jan-Apr 2012</em></h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed code bundles for Symfony, a MVC structured PHP framework</li>
                        <li>Used version control software (Git) during bundle development</li>
                        <li>Trained staff in the usage of the Symfony framework</li>
                        <li>Documented the creation process and instructions on working with various components in a 40 page documentation</li>
                        <li>Provided technical support for university students and staff</li>
                    </ul>
                    During my 1A coop work term I had two major responsibilities. The first and foremost was to provide technical support to any students and staff. This could be something simple like connection to the internet to more complex problems like when a student's laptop was rejecting certain certificates. The second responsibility I had during my work term was to work with a new framework called Symfony. It was my job to learn everything there is to know about it, teach it to staff members and then document everything to provide a reference document that the staff can use once I finished my work term.

                    <h4>Inlimite (Personal Website), <em>February 2005 - present</em><br>
                        &gt; <a href="http://inlimite.com">Website Link</a></h4>

                    I have created my website back in 2005. I began with no knowledge at all about any sort of web design or coding, and have learned it all independently during my free time. Since 2005, I have learned many techniques on how to design and code a website that is efficient and maintainable. The languages I have taught myself over the years include: PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript/JQuery and SQL. I use a MySQL database to store my data and most recently I have developed a custom MVC structured framework that will greatly improve the efficiency and reusability of code. This framework has been a big side project of mine and I continuously update and maintain my code to ensure it meets my expectations as I learn more at school and during coop terms. 


                    <h4>League of Legends Companion App, <em>March 2012</em><br>
                        &gt; <a href="https://github.com/farova/LeagueOfLegendsCompanionApp">Github Link</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LoLCompanionApp&hl=en">Android Market</a>, <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/87604/?lang=en">Playbook App World</a></h4>

                    This app was developed with a partner and was created to provide users with information about a large online video game (League of Legends). It was programmed in Java and XML which allowed it to be compatible for both Playbook and Android devices. Within the app, we have a SQLite database that holds all of the data. Github was used extensively during the development of the project, and the code may be viewed on my Github page.

                    <h4>Firefighter Robot,<em> High School Computer Engineering Class, February – June 2011</em></h4>

                    During my grade 12 Computer Engineering class, me and a partner have designed and manufactured a firefighting robot. We began with only a schematic of the circuits we were to use given to us by the teacher. From there we designed the circuit boards, manufactured them using a multi-step process, drilled the holes and soldered the various components onto them. Once our boards were completed, we began programming the code that was to process the various sensor inputs and creating a searching pattern to take the robot around the maze. The process of creating and testing the robots was a very long one, and we have very tight deadlines to meet during the term. In the end, we created a fully functional, autonomous robot that is able to navigate a maze to find fire and put it out.

                        <li>Visual Basic</li>

                    </ul>
                    I have learned C# as a part of my 1A term during university. It was the language all first year students were required to learn. I was taught Java and Visual Basic during high school courses, grades 12 and 11 respectively. I have also used C# professionally during a coop term, and used Java to develop Android applications with as a personal project.
